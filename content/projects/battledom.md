Battledom is an iOS game I started developing October 2022 and is currently in an alpha testing stage. It's an RTS-lite game that involves resource management and real time battles. I see it as an Age Of Empires lite, designed with mobile gaming in mind.

You can join the Battledom alpha via [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/IsXcGtGR).
