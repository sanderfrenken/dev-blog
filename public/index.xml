      <description>Welcome to my blog! This is the spot where I share everything about my journey becoming a game developer. A journey that I decided to take long ago.&#xA;On this blog I share technical insights but also more personal experiences. As a game developer &amp;ldquo;on the side&amp;rdquo;, a lead engineer at a large bank and a father of two, there is plenty of other stuff to cover. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect any answers on how to make life work; I don&amp;rsquo;t know either.</description>

      <description>Battledom is an iOS game I started developing October 2022 and is currently in an alpha testing stage. It&amp;rsquo;s an RTS-lite game that involves resource management and real time battles.&#xA;I see it as an Age Of Empires lite, designed with mobile gaming in mind.&#xA;You can join the Battledom alpha via TestFlight.&#xA;Please also join on Discord and Reddit if you are interested!</description>

      <description>Herodom is an iOS game I started developing June 2017 and was first released in May 2020. It&amp;rsquo;s a tower defense game that became popular after being featured in the Apple AppStore in August 2020 in many countries around the world.&#xA;Herodom is still being supported actively, but my attention has shifted a lot to it&amp;rsquo;s successor, Battledom.&#xA;You can find Herodom here in the AppStore.</description>
