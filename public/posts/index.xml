      <description>With Battledom nearing a state where I expect it&amp;rsquo;s foundations to be done, I lately spend some extra time on profiling and performance testing the game.&#xA;As Battledom can become computational quite heavy at moments when large maps are rendered while moving around hundreds of units, the topic of optimization has been crossing my path (maybe too) often.&#xA;But in general, with any app or game you develop, you will most likely at one moment in time face some form of performance issues.</description>

      <description>Tilemaps In 2016 at WWDC, Apple announced a new addition to SpriteKit: Support for tiling.&#xA;Tiling is a technique often used in (2D) game development, where maps are created using tiles.&#xA;Using spritesheets, one can have a variety of for example 100 tiles in a single image. These tiles can include terrain-like tiles, building-like tiles including walls, etc.&#xA;Example spritesheet for a terrain Using these individual tiles one can create unique environments, all drawn using the same spritesheet as a source.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog! This is the spot where I intend to share everything about my journey becoming a game developer. A journey that I decided to take long ago.&#xA;On this blog I share technical insights but also more personal experiences. As a game developer &amp;ldquo;on the side&amp;rdquo;, a lead engineer at a large bank and a father of two, there is plenty of other stuff to cover. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect any answers on how to make life work; I don&amp;rsquo;t know either.</description>
