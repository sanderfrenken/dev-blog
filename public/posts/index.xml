      <description>Tilemaps In 2016 at WWDC, Apple announced a new addition to SpriteKit: Support for tiling.&#xA;Tiling is a technique often used in (2D) game development, where maps are created using tiles.&#xA;Using spritesheets, one can have a variety of for example 100 tiles in a single image. These tiles can include terrain-like tiles, building-like tiles including walls, etc.&#xA;Example spritesheet for a terrain Using these individual tiles one can create unique environments, all drawn using the same spritesheet as a source.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog! This is the spot where I intend to share everything about my journey becoming a game developer. A journey that I decided to take long ago.&#xA;On this blog I share technical insights but also more personal experiences. As a game developer &amp;ldquo;on the side&amp;rdquo;, a lead engineer at a large bank and a father of two, there is plenty of other stuff to cover. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect any answers on how to make life work; I don&amp;rsquo;t know either.</description>
